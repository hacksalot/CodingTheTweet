CodingTheTweet
===

An **ancient custom Twitter client** illustrating how to post attributed
tweets. Reconstituted from the [Wayback Machine's][0] archives of two old blog
posts:

- [Coding the Tweet][1]
- [Coding the Tweet, Redux][2]

**Note:** This code is ~10 years old and attributed tweets are no longer
permitted by Twitter, among other API changes. It's included here for archival
purposes only.
